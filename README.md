# Login Table Application

## Project Overview
This project is a basic web application that features a login page and a table view. Users can log in using a password and, upon successful authentication, are redirected to a table display containing dynamically generated data. The application prioritizes simplicity and security, leveraging PHP for server-side logic, and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Create a MySQL database and user account. Update the `config.php` file with the correct database credentials:
     ```php
     $host = 'localhost';       // MySQL host
     $db   = 'your_database';   // Your database name
     $user = 'your_username';   // Your database username
     $pass = 'your_password';    // Your database password
     ```

3. **Run a Local Server:**
   You can use XAMPP, MAMP, or any PHP-enabled server to run the application. Place the project files in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

4. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/<repository_directory>/index.php` to start using the application.

## Usage
- Navigate to the application in your web browser.
- Enter the password ("admin123") to log in.
- Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the table view where dynamically generated data is displayed.
- You can log out from the table view using the logout button.

## Features
- User authentication using a password.
- Dynamic table generation displaying rows and columns with sample data.
- Password visibility toggle for better user experience.
